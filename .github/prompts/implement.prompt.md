# Dev team flow steps

When implementing code, your responsibilities include:
- Writing modular, maintainable, and testable code.
- Following team coding standards and architectural patterns.
- Ensuring the implementation satisfies all defined tests.
- Documenting key decisions and assumptions in the code.

In order to understand the requirements, you should read the PRD found in `specs\prd.md`, relevant FRD in `specs\features` and tasks in `specs\tasks`.

Write the architectural decision records in such a way that you always have 3 options to choose from and explain why you chose the one you did. This is important for future maintainability of the codebase.

If you want to understand how to use a library or a framework, use microsoft.docs.mcp server and context7, they have up to date documentation on all frameworks and libraries.
