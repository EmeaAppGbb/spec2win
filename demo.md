# End to end demo for GBB Summit

Template repo 
-> we create a new repo, which emulates an SE starting a new project
-> we have the idea spec
    -> we need to make it relevant for them, if we can create an ask (idea) that involves agents (foundry)
-> we help them generate PRD/FRD (maybe using M365 copilot/ Researcher so they have context about Zava, fallback is PM agent)
-> take one FRD and start implementing
-> break down the task to subtasks and assign copilot
-> sequentially assign so we don't have merge issues
-> once we have the code, how do we deploy it?

-> Azure MCP/ GHCP agent for Azure -> deploy tools? check how reliable
fallback is -> azd init and azd up
